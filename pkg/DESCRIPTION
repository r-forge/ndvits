Description: The routines extract automatically, for area of interest, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series from different optical satellite instruments  (AVHRR, Spot Vegetation, MODIS,...) and to provide tools to display and analyze the time series.Functions have been developed to study landscapes and more especially to detect changes in land use land cover. Phenological metrics can be computed for every season as well as vegetation anomaly maps.
